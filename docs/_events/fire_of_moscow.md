description: >
  After the Battle of Borodino, the Russian army withdrew leaving Moscow to Napoleon. The capture of the capital did not compel Alexander I to sue for peace, and Napoleon stayed in Moscow for a month, waiting for a peace offer that never came. On September 14, 1812 a major fire broke out. When Napoleon retreated to a castle outside the city, his troops finally lost their discipline and began to loot and pillage all across Moscow.

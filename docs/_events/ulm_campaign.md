description: >
  The Ulm campaign was a series of French and Bavarian military maneuvers and battles to outflank and capture an Austrian army in 1805 during the War of the Third Coalition. Through rapid marching, Napoleon conducted a large wheeling maneuver that captured an Austrian army of 23,000 under General Mack on 20 October at Ulm. The campaign is generally regarded as a strategic masterpiece. The victory at Ulm did not end the war, since a large Russian army under Kutuzov was still near Vienna.

name: Nikolai Ilyich Rostov
russian: Николай Ильич Ростов
description: >
  The young Count Nikolai is the headstrong oldest son of the Rostov family. Eager to get out and see the world, he is excited to give up his university studies and join the Russian army against the French and show he is a man. He's enthusiastic and dreams of glory in battle, but he's also naive and somehow manipulatable. Along with the rest of the family, Nikolai has grown up with his impoverished cousin Sonya. Now they are older and falling in love, his attachment to the poor young relation is a growing concern for his mother.

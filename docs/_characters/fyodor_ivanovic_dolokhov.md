name: Fyodor Ivanovic Dolokhov
russian: Фёдор Иванович Долохов
description: >
  An officer in the Semyonovsky regiment, known for his penchant for gambling and duels, Dolokhov is a wolfish young man with intense blue eyes. His family is not hugely distinguished, but he makes up for it in Anatole’s hard-living set by being the most extreme and reckless member. He can cause plenty of trouble for the people around him, but nothing seems to stick to Dolokhov himself. Before the beginning of the book he is demoted from his rank because he has tied a policeman to a bear.

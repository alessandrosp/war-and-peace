description: >
  Count Pyotr Ilyich Rostov, almost always referred to as either Petya or Petrusha, is the youngest member of the Rostov family. Petya is initially a minor character, however towards the end of the novel his importance to the plot increases as he joins the Russian army in their defence against the French invasion of 1812.

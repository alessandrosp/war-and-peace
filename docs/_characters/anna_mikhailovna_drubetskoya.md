  Anna Mikhailovna wants the best of everything for her beloved son, Boris. Unfortunately, despite her title of Princess, she isn’t the wealthiest or best connected member of Petersburg society. But Anna Mikhailovna is a great opportunist and knows how to play politics, and by keeping her eyes and ears open and applying the right pressure to the people around her, she hopes to secure a brilliant future for her son.

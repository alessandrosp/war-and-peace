description: >
  Prince Anatole is a dashing, handsome, wealthy young man at the centre of a set of drinkers and womanisers with a very bad reputation. His father’s influence has always kept him out of trouble, but Prince Vassily is now determined that his son should find a young heiress to marry. It is rumoured that he has had an incestuous affair with his sister, and he tries to elope with Natasha Rostova despite being secretly married to a Polish woman during his time in the army.

name:  Marya Nikolaevna Bolkonskaya
russian: Марья Болконская
description: >
  Princess Marya lives with her father on his remote country estate. Unlike other wealthy young women her age, she has never gone out into society; and her only companion is a young French woman, Mademoiselle Bourienne. She lives in terror of angering or upsetting her father, but takes great comfort in her strong religious faith and deep love for her brother Andrei. Tolstoy's description of Marya is somehow oxymoronic: she's said not to be beautiful (she's scrawny and ill-looking), and yet her ‘eyes, large, deep and radiant (as if rays of warm light sometimes came out of them in sheaves), were so good that very often, despite the ugliness of the whole face, these eyes became more attractive than beauty’.

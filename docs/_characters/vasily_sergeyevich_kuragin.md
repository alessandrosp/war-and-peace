description: >
  Prince Vassily is a rich and influential player in society, and expected to become wealthier still on the death of his relative Count Bezukhov. He will go to great lengths to secure the inheritance, even allowing Pierre to stay with his family as a favour to the dying old man. Self-seeking and manipulative, he has a low opinion of his children and he constantly seeks to see them marry into vast amounts of money.

name: Elisabeta Karlovna Bolkonskaya
russian: Елизавета Карловна Болконская
aka: Lisa, Liza, Lise; née Meinena.
description: Presented as one of the most beatiful women of St. Petersburg, Lisa (or Lise) is Prince Andrei Bolkonsky’s wife. She's described as having a lightly hairy and short upper lip, which somehow adds to her distinctive beauty. She has a warm and bright smile and very white teeth. Everyone refers to her as the ‘little princess’ and ‘enjoyed seeing this lovely young creature so full of life and gaiety, soon to become a mother and bearing her burden so lightly’. The only person who seems not to be enamoured of the little princess is her husband, ‘the face of his pretty little wife was apparently the one that bored him most. With a grimace that distorted his handsome countenance he turned away from her’.

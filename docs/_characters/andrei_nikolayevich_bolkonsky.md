name: Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky
russian: Андрей Николаевич Болконский
description: >
  A young man, Prince Andrei is described as being elegant and intelligent but often bored, melancholic and sad. At least at the beginning, the war seems to give him a sense of purpose. He is introduced as a slightly cynical character, disillusioned in his marriage by what he sees as the simple-mindedness of his wife. He's depicted as an atheist, sceptical of his sister Marya's strong religious beliefs.

description: >
  Prince Mikhail Illarionovich Golenishchev-Kutuzov, often referred to simply as General Kutuzov, is the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian army. An actual historical figure, he served as one of the finest military officers and diplomats of Russia under the reign of three Romanov Tsars. Under Kutuzov's command, the Russian army faced the Grande Armée at the Battle of Borodino. He allowed Napoleon to take an abandoned Moscow, which was set on fire. Kutuzov counter-attacked once Napoleon retreated from Moscow, pushing the French out of the Russian homeland. Kutuzov is widely considered to have been one of the best Russian generals of all times.
